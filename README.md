### Hi. In this rep soon enough you'll be able to find the masterpiece of original(or not) freelance-based websites by me myself.
### The whole repository should be considered as my real-work resume.

### You can find them on the clickable list right above:

* [A barbershop Example Site](https://github.com/detarus/Barber)
* none (Will be uploaded in a 2-3 days)
* none (Will be uploaded someday on the next week)

### Thank you for visiting this repository

### Feel free to contact me anytime for any help & job.
